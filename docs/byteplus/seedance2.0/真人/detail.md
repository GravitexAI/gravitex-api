To ensure creators can fully leverage the powerful video generation capabilities of Dreamina Seedance 2.0 for efficient video content creation, while mitigating potential risks associated with AI\-generated content, ModelArk has launched a trusted asset library for private use. Once entered, trusted assets will be added to your private asset library and can be used for video generation.
The private asset library supports the entry of **real human portrait** assets. Through **real person verification**, the ownership of portrait rights is secured at the source, helping to avoid subsequent portrait rights disputes. End users only need to authorize once; for subsequent new appearances or styles, assets of the same person can be uploaded to the same asset group without repeating the real person authentication process.

# Preparations
To access the full features of the Asset Library, you need to purchase the Advanced Creation Rights. The capacity quota is shared between Private Virtual Avatar Asset Library and Real\-human Portrait Library. For details, please refer to [Dreamina Seedance 2.0 Advanced Creation Rights Purchase Guide](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/2377608) .

# Process overview
The usage process for the real person portrait asset library is as follows:

* [Step 1: Create a real person portrait asset group (Asset Group)](/docs/ModelArk/2333589#d9a7d853)
   1. Use API to generate the H5 authentication page link. Supports passing in CallbackURL \*\*\*\* to customize the callback page link.
   2. (End user) Access the H5 authentication page link using your preferred method to complete real person authentication. After clicking the Complete button, the CallbackURL link will be opened.
   3. Parse the parameters appended to CallbackURL to obtain the real person authentication result. If real person authentication is successful (**resultCode** is **10000**), call the interface to query the Asset Group ID corresponding to the end user.
* [Step 2. Upload/manage assets](/docs/ModelArk/2333589#5c74319f)(Create Assets)
   * When real\-human assets are uploaded, the system will compare the uploaded image with the reference image collected during real person verification for facial feature consistency. Only after passing this comparison can the asset be added to the library.
   * You can use the Assets API to retrieve asset IDs, update asset information, or delete assets.
* [Step 3. Use real person portraits for video generation](/docs/ModelArk/2333589#ee62e0ae)
   * Based on real person portrait assets that have passed verification (in **Active** status), use the Asset URI to initiate a video generation task.

# About asset library

* **Asset**: An asset file (currently supports uploading images, videos, and audio files), which is a trusted asset that can be directly used for inference by ModelArk Seedance 2.0 series models.
* **Asset Group**: Each asset group corresponds to a real person, and each asset file belonging to that person is an Asset.

:::tip tip
**Caution**

* Each asset group can **only be associated with one real person.**  When an asset is added to the library, the system will compare the facial features of the uploaded image with the reference image collected during real\-person verification. If the asset is determined not to be of the same person, it will not be added to the library.
* Only assets needed for video generation inference need to be added to the library. **Do not add assets that will not be used**.
* Only the asset IDs that have been added to the library can be used for video generation. Assets of the same person that have not been added to the library cannot be used.
* Each uploaded asset will be preprocessed. You can poll the **GetAsset** API to query the processing status (corresponding parameter: **Status**).
The asset can only be used for subsequent inference when its status changes to `Active`; if the status is `Failed`, processing has failed and the asset material cannot be used for subsequent inference.
For details, refer to: [Private real-human asset library guide (Invited users only)](/docs/ModelArk/2333589).

## Step 1: Create a real person portrait asset group (Asset Group)
<span id="632b4d17"></span>
### Launch the real\-person verification H5 page
Use the POST `CreateVisualValidateSession` API to launch the real\-person verification H5 page.
The end user completes real\-person authentication using the H5Link. After clicking the complete button, the CallbackURL link will open. You can obtain the real\-person verification result by parsing the `resultCode` \*\*\*\* parameter appended to the CallbackURL address.
After the end user passes real\-person authentication (**resultCode** is **10000**), you can use the BytedToken returned by the API to query the Asset Group ID corresponding to the end user.
:::tip tip

* This API interface requires Access Key for authentication. For details, refer to [API access key management](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus-platform/docs-creating-an-accesskey).
* The account corresponding to the Access Key must have `ArkFullAccess` permission for the corresponding Project.
* The H5 verification page link on the client side is valid for 120 seconds. Authentication must be completed within 120 seconds.

:::
Include the following in the request:

* **CallbackURL**: Required. After the verification is complete, the system will automatically redirect to this URL and include the real\-person authentication result information, including whether it was successful and the BytedToken used to query the asset group ID.
* **ProjectName**: Specify the resource project name. The default is **default**. Resources within a project can only be used by inference endpoints under that project.

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/bytedance/sonic"
    "github.com/byteplus-sdk/byteplus-go-sdk-v2/byteplus"
    "github.com/byteplus-sdk/byteplus-go-sdk-v2/byteplus/credentials"
    "github.com/byteplus-sdk/byteplus-go-sdk-v2/byteplus/session"
    "github.com/byteplus-sdk/byteplus-go-sdk-v2/byteplus/universal"
)

func main() {
    config := byteplus.NewConfig().WithCredentials(credentials.NewStaticCredentials("<YOUR_AK>", "<YOUR_SK>", "")).WithRegion("ap-southeast-1")
    sess, _ := session.NewSession(config)
    resp, err := universal.New(sess).DoCall(
        universal.RequestUniversal{
            ServiceName: "ark",
            Action:      "CreateVisualValidateSession",
            Version:     "2024-01-01",
            HttpMethod:  universal.POST,
            ContentType: universal.ApplicationJSON,
        },
        &map[string]any{
            "CallbackURL": "<CALLBACK_URL>",
            "ProjectName": "default", // Asset Group will be created within this project
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    if resp == nil {
        return
    }
    respData, err := sonic.Marshal(resp)
    fmt.Println(string(respData))
}
```

Example response:
```JSON
{
    "BytedToken": "202603311449168C23BA26**************",
    "H5Link": "https://h5-v2.kych5.com?accessKeyId=AKTP0VkYjZ17vwn9YtWnXGUwwQkzcpF6*****************&secretAccessKey=fWn19Vwea1EguVm2Wy9zm6************************&sessionToken=nChAzV1A5WUxXVDhQYU9QUTV2.CiQKEE1YckFYRHRqNlZDNU1XaW4SEDD_Jk9za0wquxPCvhAQjkUQ7NytzgYYjOatzgYg6snC6QcoBDCz5IQvOiNSb2xlRm9yVmlzdWFsRmFjZS9Sb2xlRm9yVmlzdWFsRmFjZUIHYXJrX3N0Z1IRUm9sZUZvclZpc3VhbEZhY2VYA3oHYXJrX3N0Zw.gOE3_BVYksV2rgHZ8FkBHzjptcbYjJtCZBN5QvbXEP5-jdoVsmgXBb_Wg***************************&configId=10e4665b-e5c1-46d9-ac08-****************&bytedToken=202603311449168C23BA26**************&lng=zh",
    "CallbackURL": "https://www.example.com/callback"
  }
```

:::tip tip
You can specify the page language through the **lang** field in the H5Link link suffix. Currently, Simplified Chinese `zh`, English `en`, and Traditional Chinese `zh-Hant` are supported. The default value is `zh`.

:::
* Complete real\-person verification using the H5 link. After the verification is complete, the system will redirect to the CallbackURL.

:::tip tip
After the end user completes real\-person verification using H5 link and clicks the complete button, the CallbackURL link will be opened. You can parse the parameters appended to the CallbackURL link to obtain the authentication result.

* Example of parameter concatenation:

`<CallbackURL>?bytedToken=********&resultCode=10000&algorithmBaseRespCode=0&reqMeasureInfoValue=1&verify_type=real_time`

* Detailed suffix parameters:
   * bytedToken: The unique credential identifier for this authentication, used to `GetVisualValidateResult` and obtain the Group ID created in this session.
   * resultCode：
      * **When resultCode is** **`10000`** **, the verification is successful**.
   * algorithmBaseRespCode: Sub\-error code on the server side. It is recommended to check the error type corresponding to this field when resultCode is a server\-side error code.
   * reqMeasureInfoValue: Indicates whether this action is billed; the value is 0 or 1. 0 means not billed, 1 means billed. The real\-person authentication\-related services are currently free for a limited time.
   * verify_type: Authentication type, currently fixed as `real_time`.

tip
To generate an H5 link, call `CreateVisualValidateSession` again if verification fails, as the H5 link will become invalid.

:::
* Use BytedToken in POST GetVisualValidateResult to query the asset group ID created for this real\-person authentication.

<span id="99fed938"></span>
### Complete real\-person verification using H5
**End user**: Open the H5 link and complete real\-person verification on the page. After the verification is complete, click the complete button to open the CallbackURL link with appended suffix parameters.
**BytePlus client**: Parse the resultCode field in the suffix parameters appended to the CallbackURL link to determine whether the verification was successful. When **resultCode** is **10000**, real\-person authentication is successful.

### Obtain the Asset Group ID created for real person
After real\-person verification is successful, use \*\*\*\* POST GetVisualValidateResult to obtain the Asset Group ID created for this real\-person authentication.
Include the following in the request:

* **BytedToken:**  The unique credential identifier for this authentication, obtained from the response body of POST `CreateVisualValidateSession`.

:::tip tip
**BytedToken is valid for 120 seconds.** 

:::
* **ProjectName**: Specify the resource project name. The default is **default**. Resources within a project can only be used by inference endpoints under that project.

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/bytedance/sonic"
    "github.com/byteplus-sdk/byteplus-go-sdk-v2/byteplus"

<span id="5c74319f"></span>
## Step 2. Upload/manage assets
<span id="b2b3927a"></span>
### **Upload assets**
Use the **POST** `CreateAsset` API to upload assets.
:::tip tip

* Each asset group is uniquely associated with a real portrait. When asset images are uploaded, the system will compare the facial features of the uploaded image with the reference image collected during real\-person authentication. If the material is determined to be a different person, the upload will fail.
* If multiple faces are detected in the material, it cannot be uploaded.
* Each uploaded asset must undergo preprocessing. You can poll the **GetAsset** API to query the asset status (corresponding parameter is **Status**). Only when the status changes to `Active` can the asset be used for subsequent inference; if the status is `Failed`, it means processing failed and the asset cannot be used for subsequent inference.
* The upload asset (CreateAsset) API is asynchronous. System processing may result in queuing, which increases the time required for the asset to be stored in the system. No upload time SLA is guaranteed.

:::
Provide the following in the request:

* **GroupId**: Required. Asset group ID.
* **URL**: Required. The accessible URL for the image/video/audio. For specific restrictions on asset files, see [Assets API reference](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/2318271) **.** 
   * **Using image asset upload as an example, best practices for portrait asset content:** 

:::tip tip
**Full\-body reference image requirements**

* Layout: Vertical
* Image content: Full\-body frontal image of the person

:::
<div style="text-align: center">

:::tip tip
**Facial close\-up image requirements**

* Layout: Vertical
* Image content: Frontal close\-up of the person without expression, above the shoulders, with the face occupying about two\-thirds of the frame

:::
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://p9-arcosite.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-goo7wpa0wc/6188f2b280eb43a3821644071a2c5485~tplv-goo7wpa0wc-image.image" width="272px" /></div>


* **AssetType**: Required. Supports uploading image/video/audio type assets. Must be specified as **Image/Video/Audio.** 
* **Name**: Optional. Asset name, which can be used to manage assets, such as the asset file name.

:::tip tip
This field can only be used for fuzzy search of assets in the ListAssets API and will not be included in Model inference. When generating a video, do not use this field to refer to assets. Please use the format "Image N" or "Video N" to refer to assets. **N** is the order of the asset among similar assets in the request body.

:::
* **Moderation**: Optional. Specifies whether to turn off the Content Pre\-filter review for the current asset.
   * By default, the Content Pre\-filter review is on.
   * To skip most non\-baseline content security review policies, set this parameter to `"Moderation": { "Strategy": "Skip"}`

:::danger danger

* To ensure this setting takes effect, **first turn off the Secure Mode** on the asset management page ([Model Playground](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ark+ap-southeast-1/experience/vision?modelId=dreamina-seedance-2-0-260128&tab=GenVideo)  **\> My assets \> Manage assets** or [Model activation](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ark+ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=model)  **\> Assets library**).
Otherwise, if the value is set to Skip, the API will return an error.
* **Please note the following impacts**:
   * **Console asset management will be permanently disabled.**  You will no longer be able to view or manage assets in the console. Assets can be managed **only via API**.
   * You will **no longer be able to authorize** real\-human portrait assets to other users.
   * This change applies to the **primary account and all sub\-accounts**. If you turn it off, it will be turned off for all.
   * This operation is **irreversible**. Once disabled, **Secure Mode** cannot be re\-enabled.
:::
* **ProjectName**: Optional. Specifies the resource project name. The default is **default** (case\-sensitive). Resources in a project can only be used by the inference endpoints under that project. For more information about project, see the related [IAM docs](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus-platform/docs-managing-projects).

:::tip tip
If **ProjectName** is not specified in the request, assets will be uploaded to the **default** project by default. Ensure that the assets and the model inference endpoint are in the same project.
:::
**Notes**:

* Each request uploads one asset file.
* This request returns the asset ID. You can use the GetAsset API to check whether the upload was successful.

### Retrieve assets (API & Console)
You can retrieve portrait assets using the following methods.

* **Console**: In the [ModelArk Console](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ark+ap-southeast-1/experience/vision?modelId=seedance-2-0-260128&tab=GenVideo) \> **My assets** \> **Real human**, you can search and view uploaded portrait assets.
* **API**：
   * **POST** GetAsset : Retrieve a single asset
   * **POST** ListAssets : Query assets
   * **POST** ListAssetGroups : Query asset group information

<span id="5a6ca952"></span>
#### Retrieve single asset information
You can use **POST** GetAsset to retrieve information for a single asset by specifying the asset ID.

#### List asset information
You can use **POST** `ListAssets` to query assets.

* Supports queries by group ID (GroupId), asset statuses (Statuses), and asset name (Name). Filter assets that meet all criteria.
* Supports fuzzy search using Name and precise search using GroupId, making it easier to retrieve required assets.

Supports sorting results using SortBy and SortOrder.

For details, see: [Real-human portrait library API reference](/docs/ModelArk/2333602).
<span id="ee62e0ae"></span>
## Step 3. Use real person portraits for video generation
After obtaining the asset ID, you can use portrait assets in the private domain to generate a video.
Use the asset URI in the **content._url.url**field of the Video Generation API to generate a video.
:::tip tip
Asset URI concatenation method: `asset://<asset_ID` **`>`** 
:::
Please refer to the [Authorized real-person assets](/docs/ModelArk/2291680#86c3831f)and the [Preset digital characters](/docs/ModelArk/2291680#2bf01416) for more information.
:::tip tip
In the Prompt passed to the model, you need to use **image 1** and **video 1** to refer to the reference assets. The asset number corresponds to the order of the assets in the request body. Do not use the Asset ID directly in the Prompt.
Example: "The girl in **image 1** is wearing the clothing from **image 2** and is arranging items on the counter. The boy in **image 3** is a customer who intends to ask the girl for contact information."
:::

```Python

## Step 1: Generate a real\-person verification link and obtain the asset group ID

1. Request `CreateVisualValidateSession`
2. Print the H5 link and `BytedToken`
3. Wait for **3 minutes**

:::tip tip
It is recommended to use the CallbackURL suffix parameter to obtain the liveness verification result; when **resultCode** is **10000** (live authentication passed), you can use `GetVisualValidateResult` to obtain the Group ID created by this live authentication.

:::
4. Poll `GetVisualValidateResult`
5. If `GroupId` is returned, print the ID and exit
6. If an error is returned, print the error

Sample code:

Waiting 3m0s before polling validation result...

GetVisualValidateResult response: {"Result":{"GroupId":"group-20260331171719-*****"},"ResponseMetadata":{"Version":"2024-01-01","Service":"ark","Region":"ap-southeast-1","RequestId":"20260331171930804FBCAD6EBE0C*****","Action":"GetVisualValidateResult"}}
Validation succeeded, GroupId = group-20260331171719-*****
```

<span id="84bf9829"></span>
## Step 2: Upload assets and retrieve asset information
After creating the asset in the following example, query the asset Status and determine whether to continue querying or return the corresponding result based on the status.
The code executes the following logic:

1. createAsset: Upload the resource and obtain AssetId
2. waitForAssetActive: Start querying, repeatedly call getAssetStatus to check the current asset status
3. Determine based on Status
   * Processing → Continue polling
   * Active → Return URL (end). After the status is `Active`, you can use the asset Asset ID (URI format) for video generation.
   * Failed → Return error (end)
4. Return the result and print the result

Sample code:
<Attachment link="https://p9-arcosite.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-goo7wpa0wc/c54bcc4b99e64130bf590bac54e13069~tplv-goo7wpa0wc-image.image" name="Upload_Asset&_Get_Asset_Info.go">Upload_Asset&_Get_Asset_Info.go</Attachment>

&nbsp;
The query result is illustrated as follows:
```JSON
asset status: Active
asset is active, URL = https://ark-media-asset-stg.tos-ap-southeast-1.volces.com/2100000825/031807095608757847.jpg?X-Tos-Algorithm=TOS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Tos-Credential=****&X-Tos-Expires=43200&X-Tos-Security-Token=****&X-Tos-Signature=****&X-Tos-SignedHeaders=host

# FAQs
<span id="bfd5e398"></span>
### Why can't I use the asset to generate a video or obtain asset information after the asset is uploaded successfully?
The asset library is isolated by **project (Project)** .

* When generating a video, you must use the inference endpoint in the **project where the asset is located** for inference.
* If the asset is uploaded successfully but fails to obtain the asset using the asset retrieval API, it may be because different **ProjectName** values were provided when calling the upload asset (CreateAsset) and asset retrieval APIs.
   * The default value of **ProjectName** is `default`. If this field is not specified, the resource will be created in the `default` project by default.
   * It is recommended to manage assets within the same project.
